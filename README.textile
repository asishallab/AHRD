h1. Automated Assignment of Human Readable Descriptions (AHRD)

Protein function has often been transferred from characterized proteins to
novel proteins based on sequence similarity, e.g. using the best BLAST hit. To
assign human readable descriptions to predicted proteins we developed a new
program called Automatic assignment of human readable descriptions (AHRD). We
aim to select descriptions that are concise and informative, precise in regard
to function and use standard nomenclature. AHRD scores BLAST hits taken from
searches against different databases on the basis of the trust put into these
databases and the local alignment quality. The BLAST hit descriptions are
tokenized into informative words and a lexical analysis scores these tokens
according to their frequency and the quality of the BLAST hits they occur in.
Shared tokens with Gene-Ontology Annotations increase the description-scoring
in order to use standard nomenclature where possible. Finally the best scoring
description is assigned.

h2. 1. Requirements:

AHRD is a Java-Program which requires Java 1.5 or higher.


h2. 2. Usage:

All AHRD-Inputs are passed to AHRD in a single YML-File.
See test/resources/ahrd_input.yml for details.
(About YAML-Format see :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)

Basically AHRD needs a FASTA-File of amino acid sequences and three different
files containing the results from different BLAST searches, in our example we
searched three databases: Uniprot/trEMBL, Uniprot/Swissprot and TAIR10.  Note,
that AHRD is generic and can make use of any number of different Blast
databases that do not have to be the above ones. If annotating genes from a
fungal genome searching for yeast-sequences of high similarity might be
recommendable.

Additionally all parameters can be set manually (see Section Parameters).

h3. 2.1. AHRD Example run:

<pre> java -Xmx2g -jar ahrd.jar ahrd_input.jar </pre>

or just execute

<pre> ant test.run </pre>

h3. 2.2. Recommended BLAST-Search:

For your query proteins you should start three independent BLAST searches e.g.
in the three different databases mentioned above:

<pre>
blastall -p blastp -i proteins.fasta -o swissprot_blastout.pairwise -d swissprot.fasta -e 0.0001 -v 200 -b 200 -m 0
</pre>

h3. 2.3. Algorithm:

Based on e-values the 200 best scoring blast results are chosen from each
database-search (e.g. Swissprot, TAIR, trEMBL). For all 600 resulting candidate
description lines a score is calculated using a lexical approach. First each
description line is passed through two regular expression filters. The first
filter discards any matching description line in order to ignore descriptions
like e.g. 'Whole genome shotgun sequence', while the second filter tailors the
description lines deleting matching parts, in order to discard e.g. the
trailing Species-Descriptions 'OS=Arabidopsis thaliana [...]". In the second
step the scoring each description line is split into single tokens, which are
passed through a blacklist filter, ignoring all matching tokens in terms of
score. Tokens are sequences of characters with a collective meaning. For each
token a score is calculated from three single scores with different weights,
the bit score, the database score and the overlap score. The bit score is
provided within the blast result. The database score is a fixed score for each
blast database, based on the description quality of the database. The overlap
score reflects the overlap of the query and subject sequence. In the second
step the sum of all token scores from a description line is divided by a
correction factor that avoids the scoring system from being biased towards
longer or shorter description lines. In the third step the predicted gene
ontology terms, if available, are used to evaluate the description lines and to
get a better ranking. Therefore only gene ontology terms with a probability
greater than 0.4 are used. From this ranking now the best scoring description
line can be chosen. In the last step a domain name provided by InterProScan
results, if available, is extracted and appended to the best scoring
description line for each uncharacterized protein.

In the end for each uncharacterized protein a description line is selected that
comes from a high-scoring BLAST match, that contains words occurring frequently
in the descriptions of highest scoring BLAST matches and that does not contain
meaningless "fill words". If available an assigned Interpro domain is appended
to the description line and each line will contain an evaluation section that
reflects the significance of the assigned human readable description.

h4. Pseudo-Code

# Choose 600 best scoring blast results
# Filter description lines of above blast-results using regular expressions:
## Reject those matched by any regex given in e.g. ./test/resources/blacklist_descline.txt,
## Delete those parts of each description line, matching any regex in e.g. ./test/resources/filter_descline_sprot.txt. 
# Divide each description line into tokens (characters of collective meaning)
## In terms of score ignore any tokens matching regexs given e.g. in ./test/resources/blacklist_token.txt.
# Token score (calculated from: bitscore, database weight, overlap score)
# Lexical score (calculated from: Token score, High score factor, Pattern factor, Correction factor)
# Description score (calculated from: Lexical score, GO score, Blast score)
# Choose best scoring description line
# Append InterProScan description to chosen description line if available
